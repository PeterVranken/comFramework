<h1 data-number="1"
id="excelexporter---rendering-excel-spreadsheets-as-text"><span

Spreadsheets as Text</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This archive contains the binary distribution of excelExporter, an
application that can translate the information found in one or more
Excel workbooks into manifold textual representations. excelExporter is
a general purpose text rendering application for Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>excelExporter is the auxiliary code generator from the <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/tree/main/">comFramework</a>
project. However, the use of excelExporter is in no way restricted to
the context of CAN interface generation in embedded, automotive software
development. Because of its generality we decided to publish it as
independent SourceForge project. This relates to the binaries and the
documentation. The source code and the build scripts remain part of
project comFramework; some of the links down here will thus point to
that other project.</p>
<p>The principal aim of the tool is supporting automation tasks in
software development environments. In the context of the comFramework
project this targets the handling of data dictionaries and interfaces
but excelExporter is by design independent from this intended purpose
and will be useful for various other automation tasks.</p>
<p>You can render the information in the Excel input for example as:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML or LaTeX for reporting and documentation</li>
<li>Various XML formats for interfacing with other applications</li>
<li>C/C++ or any other textual programming languages</li>
</ul>
<p>In- and output description are decoupled in the parametrization of
the tool. First you will specify a set of Excel input files. All of
these are parsed and merged to one large data structure, often referred
to as <em>data model</em>. Input files of same or of different format
are supported. (“Format” refers to the structure of the Excel files with
respect to contained sheets and columns.)</p>
<p>Secondary, you will define a list of output files. The specification
of each output file is associated with the specification of a
StringTemplate V4 template file. The template controls the output
generation and this is how the same information is rendered once as HTML
code and once as - for example - C program fragment.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="documentation"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Documentation</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1"
id="command-line-interface-of-excelexporter"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Command line interface of
excelExporter</h3>
<p>The usage of the tool is explained in the application’s command line
usage text: Begin with running excelExporter with command line option
–help.</p>
<p>The command line interface of the application has the following
concept:</p>
<p>The arguments form groups. A group of successive arguments can
specify an input file, another group can specify another input file or
an output file and so on. The beginning of a group of arguments is
recognized by a specific argument, the principal argument of the group.
The usage text typically says “this argument opens the context of …”.
Naturally, the same command line switches can be repeatedly used, once
in each group of same kind.</p>
<p>Such a group of command line arguments or a “context” actually is the
representation of an object in the parameter tree of the application.
This is the model behind the parameter tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root elements are either Excel input file specifications,
specifications of generated output files or worksheet templates</li>
<li>The input file specification contains the Excel file name and it has
any number of worksheet selection objects as children
<ul>
<li>A worksheet selection specifies one or more worksheets for parsing.
All sheets or any sub-set of sheets of a workbook can be parsed.
Selection can be made by name or by index</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An output file specification contains the file name and information
about the StringTemplate V4 template to be applied</li>
<li>A worksheet template is a set of rules how to interpret one or more
worksheets. It can be applied to a particular worksheet or to several of
those, from either one or from several input files. It describes how the
data of a worksheet is organized in terms of groups and sub-groups. It
has any number of column attributes objects as children
<ul>
<li>A column attributes object specifies properties of a column, like
name and sort order</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the command line arguments from a group or context there are
“traditional” command line arguments, which relate to the run of the
application as a whole, like logging and verbosity settings. The
application usage text says they belong to the global context.</p>
<p>Please note, different to the common GNU command line interface this
application demands a blank between the switch and its value. For
example -oMyOutputFile.c would be rejected, whereas -o MyOutputFile.c
would be the correct specification of a generated output file.</p>
<p>The application’s command line arguments relate to the definition of
in- and output files and how to parse the input. This should be
understood after reading the application usage text. To successfully use
the application one still needs to understand the internal
representation of the read input data (i.e., the data model) and the way
it is rendered in the output files. The next sections explain the
available, related documentation.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="the-data-model"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The data model</h3>
<p>The internal representation of the parsed input information is
explained in detail in Wiki page <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/excelexporter/wiki/The%20Data%20Model/">excelExporter’s
Data Model</a> and it is documented as a <a
href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html?overview-summary.html">Javadoc
of the complete data structure</a>.</p>
<p>In the Javadoc you find the documentation of all public elements of
the data structure that are accessible from the StringTemplate V4
templates. The data structure is deeply nested, and actually, it are
even two data structures, which are passed to the rendering process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parsed information forms an object of class
<em>Cluster</em></li>
<li>The information about output files plus some environmental
information is put into an object of class <em>Info</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You will study the Javadoc pages to see, which pieces of information
to be used from within a template.</p>
<p>Please note, the Javadoc describes the different elements (classes)
of the data model. Their nesting is not fully transparent from the
Javadoc since recursive structures are involved. The actual structure of
the data model will depend on (and reflect) the structure the input data
is organized in. Only in the most simple case it’s a linear list of so
called <a
href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/excelExporter/excelParser/dataModel/RowObject.html">RowObjects</a>,
which represent a single row from the Excel input file and which consist
of so called <a
href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/excelExporter/trunk/doc/dataModel/excelExporter/excelParser/dataModel/CellObject.html">CellObjects</a>.
In all other cases the actual data structure depends on your input data,
on the format of your Excel file and on your application configuration
(which all needs to be consistent with one another).</p>
<p>The explanation of the data model and how its structure depends on
Excel input and application configuration is given in the Wiki page
mentioned before.</p>
<p>Another source of knowledge about the data model and how to access
its elements is the investigation of the sample templates: <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/tree/main/excelExporter/samples/">excelExporter/samples/…/*.stg</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3" id="the-stringtemplate-v4-templates"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> The StringTemplate V4
templates</h3>
<p>The technique of rendering the information held in a <em>Cluster</em>
and an <em>Info</em> object is well documented. The two objects are
passed to the StringTemplate V4 template engine and this engine is fully
documented. Please refer to <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/"
class="uri">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a> or find a printable
version of the documentation as <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/blob/main/excelExporter/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf"
class="uri">https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/blob/main/excelExporter/doc/ST4-270115-0836-52.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Please note, as a matter of experience, you will have to read the
StringTemplate V4 documentation entirely before you can start to
successfully develop your first useful template. StringTemplate V4 is
powerful and convenient but not self-explaining.</p>
<p>Studying the samples <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/tree/main/excelExporter/samples/">excelExporter/samples/…/*.stg</a>
is another important source of information.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.4" id="the-wiki-pages"><span

comprehensive, self-contained (printable) manual is not planned. As of
today, February 2023, we have the following discussions in the Wiki

<h2 data-number="1.3" id="installation"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Installation</h2>
<p>excelExporter is a Java 18 application. The installation is as simple
as unpacking an archive and optionally setting an environment variable.
It is described in detail in the file <a
href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/blob/main/excelExporter/doc/installation.txt">installation.txt</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="whats-new"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> What’s new</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.4.1" id="release-1.2"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Release 1.2</h3>
<p>Update of data model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cell representation now offers a JSON and widely C/C++
compatible text representation, so that string objects of these contexts
can be created.</li>
<li>Update of data model: The support of string comparison operations
has been adopted from codeGenerator. &lt;info.str&gt; is a new
attribute, which offers some comparison operations, including matching
to regular expressions. Text fields of the data model (e.g., cell
contents) can be compared with one another or with expected
contents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.4.2" id="release-1.1"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Release 1.1</h3>
<p>Update of data model: The cell object now contains the field “is”,
which is a map with a single key/value pair. The key is the text
contents of the cell and the value is a Boolean true. This allows to do
string compares with the cell contents in a template. The use case is
using cells as selector for different, enumerated options; those cells
must contain one out of a limited set of predefined possible character
strings and the template can check, which one it is.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.3" id="release-1.0.5"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Release 1.0.5</h3>
<p>Integration of latest release of StringTemplate V4, which is
4.3.3.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.4" id="release-1.0.4"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Release 1.0.4</h3>
<p>Migration of source code to Java Open JDK 18.0.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.5" id="release-1.0.3"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.5</span> Release 1.0.3</h3>
<p>Text output, which contains non ASCII characters is now saved to file
as UTF-8. (Used to be a non specified, default code page.)</p>
<p>Master sample “renderTable” re-designed. This actually is a small
convenience application, which strongly simplifies the use of
excelExporter for the most common use cases.</p>
<p>Fix: We found an Excel workbook, which let to still unexpected
runtime errors of POI when evaluating the cell contents. These Java
RuntimeExceptions had made the application immediately abort rather then
reporting the problem. Now, the evaluation of affected cells is skipped
with warning and no reasonable cell contents are accessible from the
templates.</p>
<p>excelExporter has been migrated to the recent release of
StringTemplate V4, which is 4.3.1. The only noticeable difference should
be a fix of the white space handling in StringTemplate. It used to be
very difficult to precisely control the generation of blank lines in the
output. With this fix, the newline characters found in the templates are
accurately conveyed into the generated output.</p>
<p>Caution, this will likely mean that this version of the code
generator will produce different output when using the same, existing
templates. The differences are however restricted to blank lines and
should not matter in C code generation environments.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.6" id="release-1.0"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.6</span> Release 1.0</h3>
<p>After more than a year of hassle-free productive use of the tool we
decided to make it a release and change the major field of the revision
designation to one - even if there’s only little new functionality.</p>
<p>New sample renderTable: This folder contains pre-configured files for
the most common use case of excelExporter. Copy these files to have a
fully operational starting point for your excelExporter application -
out of the box and without struggling with the complex and cumbersome
command line of the tool.</p>
<p>Error handling improved. Internal errors of StringTemplate V4 during
rendering are now streamlined with the application logging. Before, they
were printed in the log (together with the bulky but in the given
context meaningless Java stack frame) but were not recognized or counted
by the application.</p>
<p>Minor improvements of documentation.</p>
<p>Fix: The field “isBlank” of a CellObject in the data model was not
operational. Blank cells are not put into the data model at all; so any
access to this field would evaluate to either false (for normal, non
blank cells) or null (for blank cells). Now the data model offers the
logically inverse as isNotBlank: This evaluates to true for normal, non
blank cells or null (interpreted as false) for blank cells. This change
is the only reason for the increase of the version number of the data
model.</p>
<p>There should be no functional change for existing templates, which
make use of the no longer existing field CellObject.isBlank: The
behavior should be as wrong as it used to be. However, using the new
field CellObject.isNotBlank, they can now be repaired.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.7" id="release-0.18"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.7</span> Release 0.18</h3>
<p>New cell type “date” introduced for spreadsheet cell objects. Time
and date designations read from an Excel spreadsheet can now be rendered
with the StringTemplate V4 DateRenderer and using format strings, which
are similar to the Java class SimpleDateFormat.</p>
<p>A new sample has been added, timeAndDate, which demonstrates the new
capabilities.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.8" id="release-0.17"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.8</span> Release 0.17</h3>
<p>Documentation extended and many corrections made on
documentation.</p>
<p>The row object container got the new field prop to support the common
use case of groups with a single row object.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.4.9" id="release-0.16"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.9</span> Release 0.16</h3>
<p>The initial release. Full functionality of the application but
preliminary state of samples and documentation.</p>
