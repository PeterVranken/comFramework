/**
 * Package dataModel is the set of nested classes, which form the two objects, <a
 * href="Cluster.html">Cluster</a> and <a href="Info.html">Info</a> Info, which are passed
 * in to the StringTemplate V4 template engine as attributes of the root template. Knowing
 * the details of these classes is essential for writing StringTemplate V4 templates for
 * the application ExcelExporter: The public fields and public get methods of the classes
 * described here are accessible from within the template.<p>
 *   An overview on the data model including UML diagrams and an explanation with examples
 * how to use it can be found online in the Wiki page <a
 * href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/wiki/The-excelExporter-Data-Model">The excelExporter Data Model</a>
 * of the excelExporter project.
