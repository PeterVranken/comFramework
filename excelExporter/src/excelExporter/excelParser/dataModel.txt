Parameters and resulting data model:

- XLS File:1..n
  - sheet:0..n  sheet adresses a work sheet by name. Index based access is not supported
                Not stating a sheet means to select all of them. The order
                of work sheets is retained; an array will be appropriate
                in the data model. Specific ordering seems not to be a
                requirement here
    - idx line column titles  Optional. If not given then the column
                              titles need to be set in sub-section colum
                              for all coulumns
    - first data line
    - last data line
    - column:0..n  No column specification can be useful for most simple
                   applications. POI will find the rectangular area, which
                   is modeled as number of homogenous rows
      - title:0..1  Override column title read from designated line.
                    Mandatory, if no such line exists
      - grouping  Boolean: This is a grouping column. The priority is
                  implicit, in the order of column declarations
      - sort order  The elements of the group can be sorted
                    lexicographical, numerical or in order of appearance
