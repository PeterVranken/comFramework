The UML diagrams in this folder have been created and are maintained using
UMLet. The applied version is UMLet version 15.1 2021-05-06.

See http://www.umlet.com/ for a download.

Umlet's export-as-jpg operation saves the images with the internally
computed size, which is not under control of the user. Most renderers
rescale a jpg image so that the absolute size is irrelevant but the
SourceForge viewer for our markdown based documentation doesn't and
truncates the figures. After export from UMLet we need to resize them with
the Windows standard tool Paint. The aimed size is 20cm width, which means
a rescaling by about 75%.
