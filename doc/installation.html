<!-- Installation -->

<h1 data-number="1" id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>comFramework is distributed as a ZIP archive. The initial
installation step is unzipping the contents to a directory of your
choice. The directory should grant read and write access to all
users.</p>
<p>The downloaded comFramework archive contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The source files of the CAN interface engine for integration in
target projects.</li>
<li>A couple of sample integrations of the CAN interface.</li>
<li>The Java applications, that implement the two code generators, which
support the interface design.</li>
<li>Many code generators samples, that demonstrate how to write useful
code generation templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source files of the CAN interface don&#39;t need any installation.
(With the trivial exception of a text editor to open and read them.)</p>
<p>The DBC code generator is always needed. Its installation means to
provide a Java runtime environment 8 (aka 1.8) or higher, to set two
environment variables and optionally to extend the system&#39;s search
path.</p>
<p>excelExporter, the auxiliary code generator, is not essential but
useful. excelExporter uses the same Java runtime environment as the DBC
code generator. The additional installation effort is no more than
setting an environment variable and optionally to extend the system&#39;s
search path.</p>
<p>Having this done, productive work with comFramework can already begin
â€“ the rest is optional: A Java JDK and C (cross) compilers are (only)
needed to build the comFramework tools from the Java source code or to
build the sample integrations for deeper investigation.</p>
<p>The sample integrations come along with the generated C source code.
They are mainly meant as instructive sample code. An installation of
tools is not required if this suffices, if there&#39;s no need or intention
to alter the sample code and re-compile it.</p>
<p>The Arduino sample comes along with source code and the compiled
executable; you can immediately upload it to your Arduino Mega 2560
board and see how it behaves. An installation of Arduino 1.8.19 is
required.</p>
<p>If the Windows examples should be needed as running applications for
further investigation or debugging then GCC needs to be installed. 32
and 64 Bit versions are supported but only a few versions of GCC have
been tested; see <a href="https://petervranken.github.io/comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/winTestMT/whichCCompilerToUse.html">whichCCompilerToUse.html</a>
for details. The file can be found locally as
<em>comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/winTestMT/whichCCompilerToUse.html</em>.</p>
<p>All C compilation and related operations is controlled from
makefiles, which need the MinGW port of GNU make 3.82 or higher. If you
type &quot;make --version&quot; in a shell window this revision of make needs to
respond. Other make derivatives or elder revisions of GNU make won&#39;t
probably work.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="java"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Java</h1>
<p>A Java SDK or RTE is not element of this repository but required for
build or execution, respectively. A Java SDK of version 23 or higher is
recommended. The installation of an according Java system can be
downloaded here <a href="https://jdk.java.net/23/">https://jdk.java.net/23/</a> (visited
November 2024).</p>
<p>After installing the Java package, you need to make the executables
accessible. Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the Windows search path. Add the path to the folder
containing java.exe to environment variable PATH.</li>
<li>Create a new environment variable COMFRAMEWORK_JAVA_HOME and assign
the Java JRE installation path. The right path is the one, which
contains bin\java.exe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either of the two may be done globally and persistently or locally in
the startup scripting of your project, which makes use of
comFramework.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="code-generator"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Code generator</h1>
<p>The installation of the main code generator is described in detail in
file <a href="https://petervranken.github.io/comFramework/codeGenerator/doc/installation.html">installation.html</a>;
the file can be found locally as
<em>comFramework/codeGenerator/doc/installation.html</em>.</p>
<p>For more details on running the code generator, see the readMe.md
files in the root directory of the examples that come with the code
generator.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="excelexporter"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> excelExporter</h1>
<p>The installation of the auxiliary code generator excelExporter is
described in detail in file <a href="https://petervranken.github.io/comFramework/excelExporter/doc/installation.html">installation.html</a>;
the file can be found locally as
<em>comFramework/excelExporter/doc/installation.html</em>.</p>
<p>For more details on running the code generator, see the readMe.md
files in the root directory of the examples that come with
excelExporter.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="arduino-sample-integrations"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Arduino sample integrations</h1>
<p>Arduino 1.8.19 needs to be installed for compilation of the Arduino
samples and even for upload of the pre-compiled binaries. (The GCC avr
tools are taken from the Arduino installation.) Please refer to <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">http://www.arduino.cc/</a> (visited
November 2024).</p>
<p>Caution: Do not install the elder revision Arduino 1.6.5: This
package did not contain all required GCC avr tools.</p>
<p>A new environment variable needs to be set. Let ARDUINO_HOME point to
the root directory of the Arduino installation. All tools are located
via this variable.</p>
<p>An installation of MinGW make is required. Modify the system path
variable such that GNU MinGW make 3.82 is found when typing &quot;make&quot;.</p>
<p>In a shell window type:</p>
<pre><code>make --version</code></pre>
<p>The MinGW port of GNU make 3.82 should respond. Now CD to one of the
root directories
<em>comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/arduinoSampleIntegration</em>
or
<em>comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/arduinoSampleIntegrationEmbeddedCoder</em>
of the Arduino samples and type:</p>
<pre><code>make help
make -s clean
make -s build</code></pre>
<p>to rebuild the sample (which includes the generation of the network
database dependent C code of the CAN interface).</p>
<p>Please refer to file <em>readMe.md</em> in the root of the Arduino
samples for further details.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="windows-sample-integrations"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Windows sample integrations</h1>
<p>GNU make 3.82 needs to be installed. Under Windows, only use MinGW
distributions. The Cygwin distributions will probably need some
modifications of the makefiles.</p>
<p>The GNU C compiler GCC (32 or 64 Bit, e.g.,
mingw-i686-8.1.0-release-win32-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0 or
mingw-w64-x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0) needs to be installed.</p>
<p>Compilation of the Windows samples has been done under Windows 7 and
10. The code is free of specific operating system calls and only uses
functions from the GCC libraries. As these are widely operating system
independent the sample should compile and run under other Windows
versions, Linux and Mac OS as well; this has however never been tested
and as a matter of experience most often there are some minor
incompatibilities, which have to be sorted out first â€“ just give it a
try.</p>
<p>Using another compiler than GCC will mean code changes in the
application interface, command line evaluation in the first place.</p>
<p>On principle, the makefiles are prepared to support the compilation
under Linux and Mac OS as well. If problems appear you should first have
a look into sub-makefile <em>locateTools.mk</em>, which is responsible
to find the paths to the executables. There are different configuration
possibilities to find the tools either via system search path or via
environment variable settings. Maybe you need to alter this
configuration first. The same holds if you have different GCC revisions
installed and want to switch between them.</p>
<p>If MinGW GNU make 3.82 and GCC are installed then you can CD to the
root directory
<em>comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/winSampleIntegration</em>
or <em>comFramework/canInterface/sampleIntegrations/winTestMT</em> of
the Windows sample integrations and type:</p>
<pre><code>make help
make -s clean
make -s build</code></pre>
<p>to rebuild the samples (which includes the generation of the network
database dependent C code of the CAN interface).</p>
<p>Please refer to files <em>readMe.md</em> in the root of the Windows
samples for further details.</p>
