= About this Branch

This folder contains the import of folder
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/canInterface/branches/generateRandomDbc[^],
revision 278, May 15th, 2018, 21:28:20, from the original Sourceforge
repository, which had been used before this GitHub repository.

The folder contains a simple GNU Octave tool to generate DBC files with
random contents. The tools has been applied to produce test data for the
true comFramework tools.

This is the copy of an SVN branch. This is not a development branch in the
sense of Git! Branches in SVN and Git have different concepts. This is not
a branch, which must ever be merged into main! It is just the container
for some different but closely related stuff.
