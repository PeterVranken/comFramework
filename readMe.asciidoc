= About this Branch

This folder contains the import of folder
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/comframe/code/canInterface/branches/devThrdSafeQueue[^],
revision 447, May 11th, 2022, 22:31:26, from the original SourceForge
repository, which had been used before this GitHub repository.

The folder contains several applications and test cases for the thread-
and multi-core safe communication queue implementation, which is a core
element of the design of the CAN interface.

This is the copy of an SVN branch. This is not a development branch in the
sense of Git! Branches in SVN and Git have different concepts. This is not
a branch, which must ever be merged into main! It is just the container
for some different but closely related stuff.
