<h1 data-number="1" id="the-can-interface"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The CAN interface</h1>
<p>This is the implementation of the comFramework CAN interface
engine.</p>
<p>Folder <code>code</code> contains the source code of the engine.
There are no other files, particularly no build scripts as the interface
engine is intended for integration into a real project as source code.
The files from this folder are typically added to an existing build
project for the aimed target platform.</p>
<p>Folder <code>sampleIntegrations</code> contains source code and build
scripts for several demo applications of the CAN interface. The
reproduction of the build requires a particular build tool chain; out of
the box we use Arduino 1.8 and MinGW GCC for Windows.</p>
<p>Please refer to the project Wiki with the documentation of the CAN
interface and the readMe files of the available sample integrations for

<h1 data-number="2" id="whats-new"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> What&#39;s new</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="release-20"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Release 2.0</h2>
<p>An redesign of the software&#39;s class model has been made. It targets
at enlarging the number of supported integration use cases. It&#39;s now
straight forward to integrate into fully memory protected or managed
systems or to operated closer to the CAN hardware, with leaner software
buffering strategies.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first have a look at revision 1.x. There is a single global
(and implicit) instance of the whole. It has any number of event
dispatchers and each dispatcher has one event queue and one handle map,
which associates the external events got via the queue with the
internally registered event sources.</p>
<p>In revision 2.0, the &quot;whole&quot; thing of 1.x becomes the new dispatcher
system. Any number of such systems can be created. A system has any
number of dispatchers.</p>
<p>Revision 2.0 introduces interfaces and implementations of those. A
dispatcher no longer has an event queue. Instead, it now has any number
of event receiver ports and these ports can connect to an arbitrary
implementation of the event receiver interface.</p>
<p>The additional definition of an event sender interface allows the
implementation of &quot;connectors&quot;, which have both types of ports: Events
can be submitted via the connector&#39;s sender port and the dispatcher can
consume the submitted events if one of its ports is connected to the
connector&#39;s receiver port. The event queue implementation known from
revision 1.x is now available as such a connector object.</p>
<p>The new sender object has a sender port and provides an API, which
strongly resembles the event posting API of the 1.x dispatcher: Creating
a sender, a connector-queue and a dispatcher and connecting them in
chain yields a configuration, which is compatible with the monolithic
construct of revision 1.x.</p>
<p>The malloc API of 1.x has been substituted by a memory pool
interface. The different objects can be created from the same or from
different memory pool instances - which is the concept to support memory
protected or managed systems.</p>
<p>Of course, to facilitate the code migration, the malloc API
implementation known from 1.x is now available as an implementation of
the memory pool interface.</p>
<p>Handle mapping has always been a major issue in integrating the CAN
interface. Already 1.x had used an interface to connect to a map
instance in order to allow arbitrary mapping strategies. This has been
even more generalized and a number of map implementations is provided,
which should cover all existing use cases.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="release-15"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Release 1.5</h2>
<p>A new, abstract event source has been offered for the dispatcher
mechanism. It can be applied for posting events, which are not directly
related to a particular CAN bus or frame. Use case are events from some
application code, which relate somehow to the CAN communication, but
which are not as prototypical as e.g. a frame Rx/Tx or bus-off
event.</p>
<p>Note, this extension means an incompatible change of the existing API
cde_initModule(). Existing code won&#39;t compile.</p>
<p>Better support of CAN FD by a new queue implementation. The new
implementation can save a significant amount of RAM if events of varying
size are processed. The elder implementation allocated a fixed amount of
memory for each event, which means a waste of memory particularly for
CAN FD, where the majority of frames still have up to eight Byte but a
few of 64 Byte need to be handled, too.</p>
<p>Major bug fix: The CAN interface used to represent CAN IDs as an
ordinary integer numbers, disregarding whether it were a standard 11 Bit
or an extended 29 Bit ID. Now it uses a struct with two fields to store
numeric value and kind of ID independently.</p>
<p>Note, this repair means an incompatible API change of the CAN
interface engine. Existing code won&#39;t compile. Moreover, the
StringTemplate V4 templates of typical comFramework client projects will
require adaptation to serve the new data type for CAN IDs.</p>
<p>The sample code for Windows has been migrated to a recent revision of
MinGW GCC (8.1.0, 32 Bit and 64 Bit).</p>
<p>There are some minor bug fixes of the sample code and the
makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="release-14"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Release 1.4</h2>
<p>New commonly usable templates have been added to the
project-independent library template file codeGenC.stg: bitMask and
bitMaskCalc to provide bit masks for typical signal operations.</p>
<p>The documentation has been improved and there are some minor bug
fixes of the sample code and the makefiles.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="release-13"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Release 1.3</h2>
<p>The implementation of the CAN interface engine (also referred to as
dispatcher engine) makes use of a new implementation of the thread-safe
dispatcher queue. The API is unchanged and existing code building on
1.2.1 will be compilable without modifications and it&#39;ll show unchanged
behavior.</p>
<p>The new queue no longer makes any restrictions on thread priorities.
It is a lock-free implementation that can run in any multi-threaded or
multi-core environment. The elder implementation required that the a CAN
event notifying execution context (a CAN interrupt usually) had a higher
priority than and could never be preempted by the execution context of
the CAN consuming APSW code. This is the normal situation on any
single-core RTOS platform but not beyond. Now, the sources of CAN events
and the receiving APSW tasks can run on different cores or in different
threads of arbitrary priority and with arbitrary scheduling scheme.</p>
<p>A new test application runs the CAN interface in a POSIX
multi-threading environment. Dispatcher queues connect several tasks,
which can all preempt one another and which are not restricted to run on
a single core.</p>
<p>The new test application is at the same time a new sample
integration, which demonstrates how to design a different, more
conventional architecture of the CAN interface and how to let the code
generator generate CRC based end-to-end protection functions for CAN
frames.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="release-121"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Release 1.2.1</h2>
<p>The thread safe implementation of the event queue has been supported
by a memory barrier between data manipulation and acknowledge. This
might be necessary on particular platforms. A platform dependent #define
becomes element of the configuration.</p>
<p>Bug fix: All sample integrations&#39; StringTemplate V4 templates had
generated the conversion macros binary-value-to-world-value and vice
versa only for signals, which are either sent or received by the node.
This was inconsistent with the generation of signal initialization code,
which had been generated for all the signals of a frame. The
initialization code may depend on the conversion macros. Now, the
templates generate the conversion macros for all signals, even those,
which are not transmitted by the node.</p>
<p>The interface descriptions for Embedded Coder and TargetLink
generated by the samples will now list all signals of a transmitted
frame. So far, only sent and received signals had been listed. Although
this is basically correct was it found to be hindering because many real
network databases don&#39;t specify senders and receivers properly for all
frames and signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: A misplaced &lt;endif&gt; was found in the sample
integrations&#39; templates. The #define&#39;s that make minimum and maximum of
a signal public were only generated for scaled signals. This was not by
intention, minimum and maximum are as useful for unscaled integers. Now,
the minimum and maximum values are available as #define for all
signals.</p>
<p>Bug fix: The same misplaced &lt;endif&gt; let to unwanted suppression
of parts of the Embedded Coder interface. For unscaled integers was the
chosen storage class mechanism not generated. This affects only the
Arduino Embedded Coder sample.</p>
