<h1 data-number="1" id="scenario"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Scenario</h1>
<p>This sample application implements a power display device for an
automotive vehicle. It reads the current values of engine rotational
speed and engine torque from the CAN bus and computes the current power
of the engine. The power is broadcasted on the CAN bus (to whom it may
concern, no specific receiver is specified). This message transfer is
regular, in- and output are repeated every 10 ms.</p>
<p>The power display sends a second frame. It counts all recognized
error events (timeout, DLC, checksum and transmission sequence). Some of
these are regularly reported by a dedicated CAN frame. However, this
frame is not only sent regularly but also in the instance of a changing
counter value. This is called the mixed mode.</p>
<p>To make the sample more instructive some less realistic CAN messages
have been invented. For whatever reasons our application can compare the
computed power and the rotational speed against some user-defined
limits. If a range is exceeded (or when we get into range again) then
and only then an according CAN frame is broadcasted. This
&quot;functionality&quot; has been specified for the only reason to have some
purely event based frames in the system. Two frames are involved: The
vehicle sends the limits and our power display sends the in-range or
range violation frame.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="involved-frames"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Involved frames</h2>
<p>StateEcu01, StateEcu02: Inbound frames to our power display. Origin
is the engine control unit. These frames contain current values of
rotational speed and torque. They are sent periodically every 10 ms.</p>
<p>UserLimits: Inbound frame for our power display application. There
may be a human machine interface in the vehicle, where the user can
enter the current ranges for the observation of rotational speed and
power. The frame is only sent when one of the settings is changed. This
will happen rarely and occasionally only.</p>
<p>InfoPowerDisplay: This frame is sent regularly by our power display.
It contains the computed power plus a status signal. This status will
indicate if the compute power is invalid or unavailable, e.g. due to
recognized errors on the input frames.</p>
<p>StatusPowerDisplay: The number of recognized checksum, DLC and
transmission sequence errors so far. Sent by the power display, when one
of the counter values alters. But no more often then every 50 ms. If no
counter value has altered during the last 1000 ms then the frame is
re-sent with same contents (except for the sequence counter of course).
If the counter values never change than this frame becomes a regular
1000 ms frame.</p>
<p>LimitsPowerDisplay: Sent by the power display in logical (not
immediate) response to frame UserLimits. When the range for speed of
rotation or power as defined by the last recently received frame
UserLimits is violated the first time or when violation the range is
over then the power display sends this frame to indicate the current in-
or out-of-range status. As long as this status doesn&#39;t change this frame
won&#39;t be sent.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="specification-of-dbc-file"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Specification of DBC file</h2>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="attributes"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Attributes</h3>
<p>The DBC file uses some application specific attributes to specify the
different behavior of the frames and signals.</p>
<p>The following frame related attributes have been defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>frameSendMode: An enumeration, which specifies the
transmission/timing pattern of the frame. Known values are &quot;regular&quot;,
&quot;event&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot;. Default value is regular</p>
<ul>
<li>regular: Purely time controlled frames. Inbound frames are expected
regularly and a timeout error is raised if they stay away. Outbound
frames are sent strictly regular</li>
<li>event: Frames are excepted to be sent when and only when their
contents change. For inbound frames it means that a timeout can&#39;t be
defined. Outbound frames are sent on data change. A minimum distance in
time is defined, which limits the frequency of send events even in case
of permanent content changes</li>
<li>mixed: Outbound frames are send on data change but no more often as
defined by the minimum distance in time. If no data change has been seen
for a second specified time parameter then the frame is sent, too.
Inbound frames are handled like regular frames with the only exception
that the timeout is related to the specified minimum send frequency</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>sendPeriod: A numeric integer value specifying the period time of
regular frames in Milliseconds. Range is [5, 10000] ms. Default value is
10 ms.</p>
<p>For mixed mode frames this value specifies the maximum time span in
between two transmission events.</p>
<p>For event mode frames this attribute is irrelevant</p></li>
<li><p>eventMinDistance: A numeric integer value specifying the minimum
distance in time between two transmission events in Milliseconds. Range
is [5, 10000] ms. Default value is 20 ms.</p>
<p>For regular frames this attribute is ignored</p></li>
<li><p>checksumStartValue: To avoid confounding frames of different CAN
IDs the checksum validation uses different checksum definitions for
different frames. An individual start value of the computation is
applied. The start value is specified with this attribute. It is an
integer number in the range [0, 255] and the default value is 0</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following signal related attributes have been defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>initialValue: A floating point number in the range [-1e99, 1e99],
which specifies the inital world value of the signal. Default value is
0.</p>
<p>For inbound frames, the API will show this value for the signal as
long as the containing frame has never been received.</p>
<p>For outbound frames, this value will be sent as long as the APSW has
not updated the API value yet</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="special-signals"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Special signals</h3>
<p>The sample implements a production level validation of the
communication. It defines a checksum and a sequence counter signal for
most frames. (Not for all however, to get more inhomogeneity and better
test coverage into the code.) The code generation process is supported
by specifying naming schemes for these signals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>checksum: If a signal has this name then it is considered an 8
Bit checksum. The checksum needs to allocate a complete byte of the
frame; it must not go across a byte location. The checksum is defined to
be the binary inverted arithmetic sum of all other frame content bytes
and the frame individual start value</p></li>
<li><p>sequenceCounter: If a signal has this name then it is considered
a cyclic sequence counter. The counter may have up to eight bit and it
may go across a byte location in the frame. The counting range is
defined by the min and max property of the signal. min &gt; max is
permitted; this means inverse counting direction. A counting cycle
always begins with min and always ends with max</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3" id="allocation-of-bits"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Allocation of bits</h3>
<p>The positioning of signals in the frames has purposely been done in
an inefficient way. This must not be considered a design error of the
sample. Useless crossing of byte boundaries, useless gaps between
signals and mixed byte ordering have been defined just to make the
required pack and unpack code more difficult and to improve the test
coverage.</p>
