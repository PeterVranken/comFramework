<h1 data-number="1" id="arduino-engine-power-display-with-mathworks-embedded-coder"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Arduino Engine Power Display with
MathWorks Embedded Coder</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="scope"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Scope</h2>
<p>This sample application implements a power display device for an
automotive vehicle. It reads the current values of engine rotational
speed and engine torque from the CAN bus and computes the current power
of the engine. The power is displayed on Arduino&#39;s LCD (2*16 characters)
and broadcasted on the CAN bus.</p>
<p>The difference to the other Arduino sample integration is that the
functional software -- the APSW, all the computation of torques and
powers -- is not hand coded but model based. A MathWorks Simulink model
specifies the functionality and it can use the code generator Embedded
Coder to translate this specification into ready-to-use C code. This
technique requires proper interfacing between the Simulink model and our
CAN interface. The sample demonstrates how our code generator can
produce an Embedded Coder script (*<em>.m</em>) so that it generates C
code, which directly connects to the CAN interface.</p>
<p>The sample code comes along with all source files and build scripts
(makefile based). It can be compiled for the Mega2560 board; other
boards will need migration work and tiny boards won&#39;t work at all
because of the RAM consumption.</p>
<p>Those who don&#39;t have the LyquidCristal shield for their Arduino Mega
can still upload and run the sample: The computed power and some
relevant status information (like CPU load and task overrun counters)
are printed regularly to the console window of the Arduino IDE. (Serial
connection must be opened at the IDE.) Please note, status information
is printed only in DEBUG compilation.</p>
<p>The build requires an Arduino 1.8.x installation. Additionally, two
environment variables need to be set. (It&#39;s double-checked by the
makefile.) The GNU avr-gcc tools, the Arduino libraries and basic file
operations are located by the makefile via these variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARDUINO_HOME: Needs to point to the Arduino installation, i.e., to
the parent folder of folders drivers, examples, hardware, etc.</li>
<li>UNIX_TOOLS_HOME: Needs to point to a folder containing UNIX
executables like cp, mv, mkdir</li>
</ul>
<p>GNU make 3.82 or higher should be in the system search path.</p>
<p>Once these pre-conditions are fullfilled, the build command would be
(Windows, other systems accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>cd &lt;...&gt;\comFramework\canInterface\sampleIntegrations\arduinoSampleIntegrationEmbeddedCoder
make build</code></pre>
<p>to build the flashable hex file or</p>
<pre><code>cd &lt;...&gt;\comFramework\canInterface\sampleIntegrations\arduinoSampleIntegrationEmbeddedCoder
make -s COM_PORT=COM10 upload</code></pre>
<p>to build and upload the application to a Arduino Mega board, which is
connected to the specified COM port.</p>
<p>Note, on Windows systems you will need the MinGW port of make, not
the Cygwin port. Many GCC distributions contain both variants, so it
depends on your system search path, which one is run. Or consider typing
<code>mingw32-make build</code>; in a Windows GCC distribution this
should be a safe reference to the right implementation of make. The
Cygwin variant uses another interface to the underlying shell and this
interface is not compatible with our makefiles.</p>
<p>Arduino 1.6 won&#39;t work out of the box; in this revision, the Arduino
people decided not to package the Arduino IDE with the GNU avr-gcc tools
and the makefile will fail to locate these tools. You will have to
modify the makefile or use your system search path settings to overcome
this. Caution, for this reason, we&#39;ve never tried this code with Arduino
1.6 so far!</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="application-design"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Application design</h1>
<p>This is a sample integration of comFramework&#39;s CAN interface but not
an Arduino sample. Arduino is just an easily available, commonly known,
easy to use platform. We designed this application to demonstrate how an
integration of the CAN interface into a real platform can look like. The
actual capabilities of the application are secondary. Our CAN interface
builds on the hardware driver layer. This means a CAN shield for
Arduino.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.0.1" id="folder-canshield"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> Folder canShield</h3>
<p>So far the integration doesn&#39;t go down to real CAN hardware. Instead
a simulation frame has been shaped, which exposes a typical CAN hardware
driver interface to the rest of the software. This interface looks like
and behaves as a real hardware driver. The interrupt characteristics of
the real hardware driver is simulated by using a random controlled,
asynchronously running task of highest priority.</p>
<p>The simulation computes triangular curves of different frequencies
for speed of rotation and engine torque. This leads to a dynamic but not
exciting behavior of the application. The implementation uses floating
point operations, which is acceptable as it is a simulation anyway and
we still have lots of CPU power reserve. The drawback of using floating
point operations is that we completely loose the feeling of how much CPU
load is produced by the CAN interface and the related pack/unpack
functions; much of the load will result from simulation and APSW.</p>
<p>The simulation code can inject the following kinds of CAN
communication errors: Timeout, wrong data length code, bad checksum, bad
sequence counter value, bus-off error (and recovery). The occurrence of
the errors is random controlled; the probabilities can be adjusted by
#define macros at compile time.</p>
<p>The fictive but realistic CAN shield API and the it feeding
simulation code have been placed in folder code\canShield. If this
application would be made a real CAN device then this folder would
become obsolete and replaced by some adaptation of the remaining code to
the actual CAN API.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.0.2" id="folder-apsw"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.2</span> Folder APSW</h3>
<p>The functional code, the application software or APSW, reads the
current speed of rotation and engine torque values, computes the current
engine power and updates the LCDisplay. It displays speed of rotation
and power and the recognized CAN communication errors.</p>
<p>The APSW is made by model based design. A MathWorks Simulink model
implements the APSW functionality and the MathWorks Embedded Coder
generates C code from this model. The generated code is part of the
sample and the code generation can be reproduced with MATLAB 2019b. To
do so, delete the folder pwr_computeEnginePower_ert_rtw. Open MATLAB and
run script initEcBusObjects.m. Open the model pwr_computeEnginePower.slx
and type Ctrl-B. The C source code is (re-)generated in folder
pwr_computeEnginePower_ert_rtw. Folder slprj is generated, too, but the
files in this folder are not required for our purpose.</p>
<p>Note, MATLAB is a non open source tool and the code generation
requires a licence. If you don&#39;t have MATLAB then you will find the
generated C code in the folder pwr_computeEnginePower_ert_rtw.</p>
<p>The CAN interface is specified to the Embedded Coder through file
code\APSW\initEcBusObjects.m. This file is generated by the comFramework
code generator from the DBC file. When executed by MATLAB it creates a
set of Simulink Bus and Signal objects, which are attached to the in-
and outports and in- and output signals of the Simulink model. This way,
the Embedded Coder can generate C source code, which seamlessly links to
the CAN interface we have generated. No additional hand-code is
needed.</p>
<p>Note, the Embedded Coder has the full interface information. This
includes the scaling of in- and output signals. The Embedded Coder is
capable to do all operations on the signals just like that in fixed
point operations. No floating point operations are involved.</p>
<p>The APSW is nearly identical to the code generator sample <a href="https://github.com/PeterVranken/comFramework/tree/main/codeGenerator/samples/EmbeddedCoderAPIWithBusStruct" title="GitHub, codeGenerator">EmbeddedCoderAPIWithBusStruct</a>. Refer
to this sample and read file <em>readMe.txt</em> to get more details
about the configuration of the Simulink/Embedded Coder model with help
of MATLAB script files that are auto-coded from the DBC files.</p>
<p>The APSW code is located in folder code\APSW.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.0.3" id="folder-integration"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.3</span> Folder integration</h3>
<p>The folder code\integration contains those hand-coded parts of the
application, which are needed to integrate the CAN interface with any
real platform (or operating system). The tasks are defined that do the
initialization of the CAN interface (frame and bus registration) and the
regular clocking of the interface engine instances. Moreover, the handle
mapping and the checksum and sequence counter update/validation, which
are external to but required by the CAN interface engine are implemented
here.</p>
<p>Please note: Handle mapping is always required by the CAN interface,
(it&#39;ll be a trivial identity in many environments like in our Arduino
integration) but checksum and sequence counter update/validation are a
matter of application specific configuration only.</p>
<p>The integration code contains the handling of bus errors, too.
Although it strongly resembles the auto-generated code for frame
handling (see below) and although it could be auto-generated, too, we
decided for hand-coding. The reason simply is that the number of CAN
buses is very low in comparison to the number of frames and that the CAN
bus configuration typically doesn&#39;t undergo frequent changes in the
course of a software project. Maintaining this code through template
programming as it would be required for auto-generated coding, won&#39;t
ever pay off.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.0.4" id="folder-codegen"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.4</span> Folder codeGen</h3>
<p>Most important is folder code\codeGen. It contains the configuration
of the CAN interface for this application. This configuration is mainly
determined by the code generation from the network database file(s). The
transmission modes and all program flow for communication validation
(timeouts, checksum and sequence counter support) are implemented here,
controlled by the attributes in the network databases. Moreover, the
global data API with the APSW, which is highly dependent on the network
databases is implemented here, too.</p>
<p>All C sources and related header files in this folder are generated
by the code generator.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.0.5" id="folder-rtos"><span class="header-section-number">2.0.5</span> Folder RTOS</h3>
<p>Last but not least we have folder RTOS. A popular open source real
time operating system for Arduino has been placed here. Nothing special
about this, maybe with the exception of file
comFramework\canInterface\sampleIntegrations\arduinoSampleIntegrationEmbeddedCoder\code\RTOS\rtosConfig\rtos.config.h,
which configures the RTOS at compile time (number of tasks, required
task communication objects, etc.).</p>
